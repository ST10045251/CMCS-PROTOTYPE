# ST10045251-PROTOTYPE
## Overview
ST10045251-PROTOTYPE is a project focused on planning and prototyping scalable and efficient solutions. This prototype provides a foundational demonstration of initial design concepts and core functionalities using various Azure services.

## Features
Project Planning: Tools and frameworks for project organization and strategy.
Prototyping: Initial design concepts, workflows, and system architecture.
Integration: Azure Storage Services integration, including Azure Tables, Azure Blob Storage, Azure Queues, and Azure Files.

## How the Project Works
### Architecture Overview
The prototype demonstrates a system architecture integrating various Azure services to manage data efficiently and ensure robust functionality.

### Core Components
Azure Tables: Manages structured data such as customer profiles and product information.
Azure Blob Storage: Handles unstructured data, including multimedia content.
Azure Queues: Manages asynchronous tasks and messaging between components.
Azure Files: Provides shared file storage accessible across different services.

### Application Flow
Data Ingestion: Data is ingested into Azure Tables and Blob Storage.
Processing: Asynchronous tasks are managed using Azure Queues to ensure smooth operations.
Access and Management: Users interact with the application, which uses Azure Files for file operations and Azure Tables for data retrieval.

### How It Works on the Website
User Interface:

The web application provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system.
Users can view and manage data, access multimedia content, and perform various tasks through intuitive web pages.
Data Interaction:

Users input data through forms or upload files, which are then processed and stored in Azure Storage services.
Data displayed on the website is retrieved from Azure Tables, while files are accessed via Azure Blob Storage.
Asynchronous Operations:

Background tasks such as data processing and notifications are handled by Azure Queues, ensuring that the website remains responsive.
File Management:

The application interacts with Azure Files for file storage and retrieval, allowing users to manage and access their files seamlessly.
Error Handling:

The website includes error handling mechanisms to manage issues and provide feedback to users if something goes wrong.
